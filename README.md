# MCGLLDA

Multiview Consensus Graph Learning for LncRNA-Disease Association Prediction

**Method Description**

MCGLLDA could serve as a useful tool for lncRNA-disease association prediction.

**Requirements**

AMVML was developed in MATLAB 2014b environment, but it should be working in all MATLAB versions. 

**Parameters**

There are two parameters alpha and beta in MCGLLDA. The default value of alpha is 0.001 and beta is 0.0001. Users can change their value in "MultiViewPrediction.m" file.

**Output**

All the results are stored in 'mat' file for convenience.
